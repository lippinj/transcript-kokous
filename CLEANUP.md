If asked to clean up a transcript file, this means the following.

The file contains an automatic transcription of some audio;
in many cases, it is of a person giving a speech. 
Usually it is in finnish.
You are to improve the structure and presentation of the text,
for example:

- Add paragraph breaks where needed
- Correct punctuation, capitalization etc. as appropriate
- Correct words that were probably misheard by the translation

When cleaning up `foo.md`, save the cleaned-up file in `foo.cleaned.md`.
Don't make changes to the original file.

The first line in the file is for metadata, do not touch it.
